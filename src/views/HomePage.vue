            <p>
                I'm Jonas Claes, a {{ age }} year old programmer and I'm currently studying for a Bachelors degree in Applied Computer Sciences at the Thomas More in Geel, Belgium.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really like programming and IT in general, and I would call myself a tech enthusiast/geek.
                You can always find me doing something, most of the time on open source projects!
            </p>

            <h1 class="text-xl">Experience</h1>
            <p>
                I've smartified my whole home, and contributed on numerous projects!
                I've also worked with numerous OT devices like Siemens PLCs and industrial controllers and networks.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up with the Siemens S7-300 series, all the way up to the new S7-1200 and S7-1500 series.
                Not only did I program these controllers, I even wrote software to communicate with them over OPC-UA from a server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything from web to hardware is right up my alley.
            </p>
